        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="muted">These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your use of Jewelry Identifier (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>
        <p class="callout"><strong>Important:</strong> Jewelry Identifier is for informational purposes only. It does not guarantee accuracy and is not a substitute for professional jewelry appraisal or valuation.</p>

        <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you represent that a parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.</p>

        <h2 id="license">License and Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the App for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App except as permitted by law.</li>
          <li>Use the App to infringe on any person's rights or violate any applicable laws.</li>
          <li>Use the App in a way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the App or interfere with others' use.</li>
          <li>Bypass or attempt to bypass any security or usage limits.</li>
          <li>Submit fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate content through the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="subscriptions">Purchases, Subscriptions, and Billing</h2>
        <p>The App offers optional paid features through in-app purchases. Prices are displayed in the App at the point of purchase and may vary by region, currency, taxes, and exchange rates. Current USD prices are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> $4.99 (auto-renewing)</li>
          <li><strong>Annual:</strong> $44.99 (auto-renewing)</li>
          <li><strong>Lifetime:</strong> $49.99 (one-time purchase)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Billing and Auto-Renewal</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase.</li>
          <li>Weekly and annual subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
          <li>Your account is charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
          <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription any time in iOS under Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions. Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Trials and Promotions</h3>
        <p>If a free trial or promotional pricing is offered, eligibility and duration are shown in-app. If you do not cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends, your subscription will begin and the applicable price will be charged for the selected term. Any unused portion of a free trial, if offered, is forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</p>
        <h3>Price Changes</h3>
        <p>We may change prices for future purchases or renewals. If required by Apple policy, you will be notified of price changes and given an option to review. Continued use or failure to cancel before renewal constitutes acceptance of the new price.</p>
        <h3>Lifetime Purchase</h3>
        <p>The Lifetime purchase is a one-time, non-transferable entitlement tied to your Apple ID. Availability and included features may change, but we intend to maintain equivalent core access for Lifetime purchasers.</p>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>Refunds are handled by Apple according to App Store policies. We do not issue refunds directly. For refund requests, see Apple's support resources or your purchase receipt.</p>

        <h2 id="information">Information and Results</h2>
        <p>The App may identify jewelry or display information about pieces, materials, and market values. We do not warrant that any result, description, or identification is accurate, complete, or up to date. Results are generated by AI and should not be relied upon as professional appraisals. You should independently verify any information before making purchasing, selling, or insurance decisions.</p>

        <h2 id="user-content">User Content</h2>
        <p>The App may allow you to save identification results or favorites. You are solely responsible for any content you create. Photos submitted for analysis are processed on our servers and deleted after results are returned.</p>

        <h2 id="third-parties">Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
        <p>The App relies on third-party services including Firebase, OpenRouter, RevenueCat, and eBay. We are not responsible for third-party content, policies, or practices. Your use of third-party services is at your own risk and subject to their terms.</p>

        <h2 id="ip">Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including all software, text, graphics, logos, and other materials, is protected by intellectual property laws. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms.</p>

        <h2 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT RESULTS WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.</p>

        <h2 id="limitation">Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE APP. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE APP WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) TO DOWNLOAD THE APP.</p>

        <h2 id="indemnity">Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the App or your violation of these Terms or applicable laws.</p>

        <h2 id="termination">Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if we believe you have violated these Terms or if we discontinue the App. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it.</p>

        <h2 id="changes">Changes to the App and Terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify the App and these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date above. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
