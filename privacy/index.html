        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="muted">This Privacy Policy explains how Jewelry Identifier ("the App", "we", "us") handles information when you use the App.</p>
        <p class="callout"><strong>At a glance</strong>: Photos you take are uploaded to our servers for AI-powered jewelry identification, then deleted after processing. We use third-party services for analysis, subscriptions, and market data. We never sell your data.</p>

        <h2 id="summary">Quick Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Photos are uploaded to our servers for AI analysis and deleted after processing.</li>
          <li>We use Firebase for infrastructure, OpenRouter for AI analysis, RevenueCat for subscriptions, and eBay for market data.</li>
          <li>Crash reports and basic diagnostics may be collected to improve stability.</li>
          <li>In-app purchases are processed by Apple. We do not receive or store your full payment card details.</li>
          <li>We receive your email and any information you include only if you contact us for support.</li>
          <li>We never sell your data.</li>
          <li>The App is intended for users aged 13 and older.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="data-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Photos and camera</h3>
        <p>The App uses your device's camera to photograph jewelry for identification. When you submit a photo for analysis, it is uploaded to our servers (Firebase Storage), processed by an AI service (via OpenRouter), and deleted from our servers after processing is complete. We do not retain your photos beyond what is needed to return results.</p>

        <h3>Account data</h3>
        <p>If you sign in via Firebase Authentication, we store basic account information (such as your user ID and email) to manage your account and entitlements.</p>

        <h3>Diagnostics and crash data</h3>
        <p>To keep the App reliable, we may access anonymized crash logs and basic diagnostics (e.g., device model, OS version, app version) provided by the platform or Firebase Crashlytics. These diagnostics do not include your photos or personal contact information.</p>

        <h3>Support communications</h3>
        <p>If you email us or otherwise contact support, we will receive your name, email address, and any information you include in your message so we can assist you.</p>

        <h3>Purchases and payments</h3>
        <p>Subscriptions are processed by Apple (In-App Purchase) and managed through RevenueCat. We receive transaction receipts and limited purchase metadata needed to validate your entitlement, but we do not receive or store your full payment card details. You can manage or cancel subscriptions in iOS under Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.</p>

        <h2 id="how-we-use">How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide core features like jewelry identification and market data.</li>

        <h2 id="third-parties">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party services that may process data on our behalf:</p>

          <li><strong>eBay</strong> — Market pricing and comparable listing data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each service operates under its own privacy policy. We share only the minimum data necessary for each service to function.</p>

        <h2 id="sharing">Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data.</li>
          <li>We do not share personal information with advertisers or data brokers.</li>
          <li>Third-party service providers listed above may process data on our behalf solely to provide their services, under appropriate safeguards.</li>
          <li>We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, safety, or the rights and safety of others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="retention">Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Photos:</strong> uploaded for AI processing and deleted from our servers after results are returned.</li>

        <h2 id="permissions">Device Permissions</h2>
        <ul>

          <li><strong>Photo Library (optional):</strong> only used if you choose to import or save an image. The App does not access your library unless you explicitly interact with those features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information, including encrypted transmission (HTTPS) for all data sent to our servers. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2 id="changes">Changes to This Policy</h2>
